# üìä Business KPI Prediction from Financial Data (PyTorch)

## 1. Introduction
This repository implements a **multi-task deep learning model** for predicting key business performance indicators (KPIs) from tabular financial/accounting data.  
The model jointly learns three predictive tasks:

- **Revenue Growth** ‚Äî regression  
- **Risk Score** ‚Äî regression  
- **Customer Churn** ‚Äî binary classification  

By training on all three tasks simultaneously, the network captures richer patterns and relationships in financial data.

## 2. Motivation
Conventional financial forecasting methods (linear models, rule-based systems, spreadsheets) struggle with **nonlinear dependencies** and **noisy real-world data**.  

This project demonstrates how **multi-task learning (MTL)** can serve as a scalable, modern approach to forecasting KPIs, providing:

- **One model ‚Üí multiple outputs**  
- **Feature integration** across categorical, numerical, and time-based inputs  
- **Extensible baseline** for real-world datasets

## 3. Dataset
- **Source:** `synthetic_financial_data_bukharii.csv` (synthetic but realistic)  
- **Records:** ~34,000 rows (500 companies √ó 68 months)  
- **Features:**  
  - *Numerical*: revenue, gross_profit, operating_margin, debt_ratio, log_revenue  
  - *Categorical*: industry, region, company_size  
  - *Temporal*: customer_tenure, date  
- **Targets:** revenue growth, risk score, churn indicator  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Dataset is synthetic and designed for experimentation.

## 4. Model Architecture
- **Base network:** Fully connected layers with BatchNorm + Dropout  
- **Output heads:**  
  - Revenue growth ‚Üí Linear regression head (MSELoss)  
  - Risk score ‚Üí Linear regression head (MSELoss)  
  - Churn ‚Üí Binary classification head (BCEWithLogitsLoss)  
- **Framework:** PyTorch

## 5. Training Setup
- **Split:** 2020‚Äì2024 ‚Üí training | 2024‚Äì2025 ‚Üí validation/testing  
- **Optimizer:** Adam (`lr = 5e-5`)  
- **Loss:** `Loss = MSE(revenue) + MSE(risk) + BCE(churn)`  
- **Batch size:** 128  
- **Epochs:** 100  

### Sample Training Output
| Epoch | Train Loss | Validation Loss |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| 1     | 1.1861     | 1.2510          |
| 5     | 0.7073     | 0.7825          |
| 10    | 0.6764     | 0.6891          |
| 15    | 0.5981     | 0.6107          |
| 20    | 0.6054     | 0.6232          |

## 6. Results
- Model shows **stable convergence** on all three tasks.  
- Training and validation losses are closely aligned ‚Üí low overfitting on synthetic data.  
- Demonstrates feasibility of **joint KPI forecasting** using deep learning.  

*(Future improvement: report R¬≤ for regression tasks and AUC/F1 for churn classification.)*
